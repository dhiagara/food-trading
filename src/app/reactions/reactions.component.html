        Google It?
        What I really needed to google was “how to use third party libraries in Angular 2+.” Which I did. And there are tons of awesome articles out there; the one that kind of pulled it all together for me was Angular CLI.
        
        So, if you are specifically using Angular 5.2.10 and want to use Matthew Wagerfield’s awesome parallax library that is mobile responsive like me, here is a real quick write-up on how to do so.
        
        NPM Install It!
        npm i -s parallax-js
